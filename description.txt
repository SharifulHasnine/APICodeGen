Hands-on

API Code Generation (Either Python/PHP, Database: MySQL, output on webpage)

Objective:

        Generate random data on database, from there print on csv file according to user input.

Steps:

        -create table on database “Sample_code” (id, code_, status)

        - Add a method which generates a code with cand insert into ‘code_’ field. (by default, ‘status’ will be 0)

        - (This is for testing, how you fill up depends on you) load the code table with random data about 5-10 lakhs of Data.

        - Create a method “generate_code (‘quantity’,’ file’, ‘column_number’) ” , ‘quantity’ will take a number input, ‘file’ will be name of a file, ‘column_number’ will be a number from 1-6.

        -inside the method first from ‘Sample_code’ table, ‘quantity’ input number of data will be fetched whose ‘status’ is 0

        -A csv file will be created with the name ‘file’ input.

        - these collection of data will be printed on the csv based on the number of ‘column_number’ with a message- ‘Your code is “code_string”’

        -After date those data which are fetched and printed will be updated on ‘Sample_code’ field as ‘status’ from 0 to 1.

        -From the initial of the code portion on “generate_code” table to last of portion a time counter will be added.

               - input will be generate_code parameters in web form.

        -output will be successful file print on csv file and the output of the time.

Sample input

        1000 3 ‘file1.csv’

Sample output

        (Along with the file stored on the directory ,output on browser)
